# Why this project is beneficial

# Project Status
I have just developed its prototype (Ver.3), POC (Proof of concept), MVP (Minimum Viable Product) whatever it's called including hardware. But I need supports especially about improving its farmware because I'm mainly an electric engineer and not so good at programming.
